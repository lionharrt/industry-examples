# Restaurant Industry Research: Ember & Oak

## 1. Color Theory & Examples
- **Primary Palette**: Deep Charcoals (#1A1A1A), Burnt Siennas (#A0522D), and Muted Gold (#D4AF37).
- **Vibe**: Warm, intimate, refined, "Michelin star" aesthetic.
- **Example Sites**: Eleven Madison Park, Mirazur, Geranium.
- **Psychology**: Dark backgrounds with high-contrast, warm accents evoke luxury and focus on the food.

## 2. Animation & Style Inspiration
- **Key Animations**: 
  - Subtle ingredient zooms on scroll.
  - Smooth menu transitions (fade-in, slide-up).
  - GSAP staggered reveals for "Tonight's Tasting" sections.
  - Parallax on high-res culinary photography.
- **Awwwards Inspiration**: "The Fat Duck" (storytelling), "Noma" (minimalism).

## 3. Media & Text Strategy
- **Media**: Extreme close-ups of textures (seared scallops, wine pouring, wood fire).
- **Typography**: Elegant Serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for titles, clean Sans-Serif (e.g., Montserrat) for descriptions.
- **Tone**: Sophisticated, sensory-driven, experiential. 
- **Sample Copy**: "A symphony of seasonal flavors, harvested at dawn and served by candlelight."
