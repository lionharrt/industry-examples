## 1. Color Theory & Examples
- **Primary Palette**: Warm Sand (#F5F1E9), Olive Green (#5D6D4F), and Deep Terracotta (#A65D43).
- **Vibe**: Grounded, tranquil, organic, mindful.
- **Example Sites**: Yoga Plus, Yoga 128, Serenity Retreats.

  - **Deep Terracotta**: Earthiness, strength, and warmth.

## 2. Animation & Style Inspiration
- **Key Animations**: 
  - **Breathe-In Reveals**: Text and images that scale subtly up and down, mimicking a breathing rhythm.
  - **Liquid Transitions**: Soft, organic morphing shapes between sections instead of hard lines.
  - **Parallax Flow**: Gentle scroll-triggered movement of natural elements (leaves, sand ripples).
  - **Minimalist Micro-interactions**: Hover effects that use soft glows or slow color bleeds rather than fast pops.
- **Style**: High-Vibrational Minimalism. Plenty of whitespace (or "breathing room"), elegant typography, and high-quality imagery of natural light.

## 3. Media & Text Strategy
- **Media**: 
  - **Natural Light**: Sun-drenched studios with natural wood and linen textures.
  - **Authentic Motion**: Real practitioners in moments of focus, not just perfect poses.
  - **Sensory Details**: Close-ups of incense, flowing water, or textured yoga mats.
- **Typography**: 
  - **Headings**: Modern Serif with wide tracking (e.g., Cormorant Garamond or Lora) for a timeless, peaceful feel.
  - **Body**: Clean, high-readability Sans-Serif (e.g., Montserrat Light or Quicksand).
- **Tone**: Gentle, inviting, yet deeply professional.
- **Sample Copy**: "Find Your Center. A sanctuary for breath, movement, and the soul."
